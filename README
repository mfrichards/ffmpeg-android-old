Building ffmpeg 0.8.10 for MyTunes Music Manager:

These instructions explain how to build ffmpeg for use on an Android device with MyTunes
Music Manager Pro. Note that these instructions are for Linux only. You should be able to
build it on Windows using Cygwin, however, I only do Android development on Linux, so do
not ask about Windows.

The build scripts used were created with the help of the bambuser project. For more
information, see:

1) To build ffmpeg you need the the Android SDK and the Android NDK installed on your
   system. I use version 6b of the ndk (android-ndk-r6b), but other versions should work.

2) Modify the "build.sh" script to point to the correct directories on your system for the
   Android NDK tools.

3) Execute "build.sh". This will configure the ffmpeg build scripts with the appropriate
   build options for Android and then call "make" to build shared libraries for the armv7a
   and armv5te architectures. The resulting libraries will be placed under the "build"
   subdirectory.

4) Execute "clean-build.sh". This removes intermediate libraries and produces the final
   shared libraries that will be installed on the device. The libraries will be placed in
   "build/ffmpeg/<architecture>/lib".

To install the new ffmpeg shared libraries on your Android device, the device must be
rooted and you must have access to the file system via the adb tool, or through DDMS
in eclipse. Copy the new shared libraries (libavcodec.so, libavformat.so, and libavutil.so)
to "/data/data/com.whitestar.mytunes.pro/lib" and restart MyTunes. The app will now be
using the new libraries.
